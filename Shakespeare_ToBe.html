        <p class="sub-item">  <h2>To be, or not to be,</h2> that is the question:<br>
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
        <b>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</b>
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        <h3>And by opposing end them.</h3>

        and by a sleep to say <b>we end<br>
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
        That flesh is heir to:</b> 'tis a consummation<br>
        Devoutly to be wish'd.

        <p class="sub-item"> For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
        The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
        The insolence of office, and the spurns
        That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
        When he himself might his quietus make
        With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        But that the dread of something after death,
        The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have
        Than fly to others that we know not of?
        Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
        And thus the native hue of resolution
        Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
        And enterprises of great pitch and moment
        With this regard their currents turn awry
        And lose the name of action.
        To die, to sleep;
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause—there's the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life.
